abstract: "The evolution of the Internet has manifested itself in many ways: the
  traffic characteristics, the interconnection topologies, and the business
  relationships among the autonomous components. It is important to understand
  why (and how) this evolution came about, and how the interplay of these
  dynamics may affect future evolution and services. We propose a network-aware,
  macroscopic model that captures the characteristics and interactions of the
  application and network providers, and show how it leads to a market
  equilibrium of the ecosystem. By analyzing the driving forces and the dynamics
  of the market equilibrium, we obtain some fundamental understandings of the
  cause and effect of the Internet evolution, which explain why some historical
  and recent evolutions have happened. Furthermore, by projecting the likely
  future evolutions, our model can help application and network providers to
  make informed business decisions so as to succeed in this competitive
  ecosystem."

abstract: With the rapid growth of congestion-sensitive and data-intensive
  applications, traditional settlement-free peering agreements with best-effort
  delivery often do not meet the QoS requirements of content providers (CPs).
  Meanwhile, Internet access providers (IAPs) feel that revenues from end-users
  are not sufficient to recoup the upgrade costs of network infrastructures.
  Consequently, some IAPs have begun to offer CPs a new type of peering
  agreement, called paid peering, under which they provide CPs with better data
  delivery quality for a fee. In this article, we model a network platform where
  an IAP makes decisions on the peering types offered to CPs and the prices
  charged to CPs and end-users. We study the optimal peering schemes for the
  IAP, i.e., to offer CPs both the paid and settlement-free peering to choose
  from or only one of them, as the objective is profit or welfare maximization.
  Our results show that 1) the IAP should always offer the paid and
  settlement-free peering under the profit-optimal and welfare-optimal schemes,
  respectively, 2) whether to simultaneously offer the other peering type is
  largely driven by the type of data traffic, e.g., text or video, and 3)
  regulators might want to encourage the IAP to allocate more network capacity
  to the settlement-free peering for increasing user welfare.

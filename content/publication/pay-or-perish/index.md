abstract: Net neutrality has recently been heavily debated as a potential
  regulation of the Internet. This debate is centered around the argument
  whether the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) should be allowed to provide
  differentiated services over the Internet. Advocates of net neutrality have
  expressed concerns about the ISPs' pricing power, which might be used to
  discriminate Content Providers (CPs), and consequently destroy innovations at
  the edge of the Internet and hurt users' utilities. However, without service
  differentiation, ISPs do not have incentives to expand infrastructure
  capacities and provide quality of services, which will eventually impair the
  development of the future Internet. Although market competition among the ISPs
  would alleviate the problem and reduce the need for net neutrality
  regulations, the problem is more severe in monopolistic markets, e.g., rural
  access markets where natural monopolies exist due to high deployment costs and
  appropriate regulations are most in need. We study the service differentiation
  offered by a monopolistic ISP and find that the ISP's profit-optimal strategy
  makes a free ordinary service damaged good, which hurts the welfare of CPs and
  their users. Instead of imposing net neutrality regulations, we propose a more
  flexible and lenient policy framework that generalizes net neutrality
  regulations. We believe that by allowing ISPs to differentiate services under
  a well-designed policy constraint, the utility of the entire Internet
  ecosystem could be greatly improved.

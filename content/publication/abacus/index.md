abstract: The emergence of the cloud computing paradigm has greatly enabled
  innovative service models, such as Platform as a Service (PaaS), and
  distributed computing frameworks, such as Map Reduce. However, most existing
  cloud systems fail to distinguish users with different preferences, or jobs of
  different natures. Consequently, they are unable to provide service
  differentiation, leading to inefficient allocations of cloud resources.
  Moreover, contentions on the resources exacerbate this inefficiency, when
  prioritizing crucial jobs is necessary, but impossible. Motivated by this, we
  propose Abacus, a generic resource management framework addressing this
  problem. Abacus interacts with users through an auction mechanism, which
  allows users to specify their priorities using budgets, and job
  characteristics via utility functions. Based on this information, Abacus
  computes the optimal allocation and scheduling of resources. Meanwhile, the
  auction mechanism in Abacus possesses important properties including incentive
  compatibility (i.e., the users' best strategy is to simply bid their true
  budgets and job utilities) and monotonicity (i.e., users are motivated to
  increase their budgets in order to receive better services). In addition, when
  the user is unclear about her utility function, Abacus automatically learns
  this function based on statistics of her previous jobs. An extensive set of
  experiments, running on Hadoop, demonstrate the high performance and other
  desirable properties of Abacus.

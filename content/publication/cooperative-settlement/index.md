abstract: "Internet service providers (ISPs) depend on one another to provide
  global network services. However, the profit-seeking nature of the ISPs leads
  to selfish behaviors that result in inefficiencies and disputes in the
  network. This concern is at the heart of the “network neutrality” debate,
  which also asks for an appropriate compensation structure that satisfies all
  types of ISPs. Our previous work showed in a general network model that the
  Shapley value has several desirable properties, and that if applied as the
  profit model, selfish ISPs would yield globally optimal routing and
  interconnecting decisions. In this paper, we use a more detailed and realistic
  network model with three classes of ISPs: content, transit, and eyeball. This
  additional detail enables us to delve much deeper into the implications of a
  Shapley settlement mechanism. We derive closed-form Shapley values for more
  structured ISP topologies and develop a dynamic programming procedure to
  compute the Shapley values under more diverse Internet topologies. We also
  identify the implications on the bilateral compensation between ISPs and the
  pricing structures for differentiated services. In practice, these results
  provide guidelines for solving disputes between ISPs and for establishing
  regulatory protocols for differentiated services and the industry."

abstract: Traditionally, Internet Access Providers (APs) only charge end-users
  for Internet access services; however, to recoup infrastructure costs and
  increase revenues, some APs have recently adopted two-sided pricing schemes
  under which both end-users and content providers are charged. Meanwhile, with
  the rapid growth of traffic, network congestion could seriously degrade user
  experiences and influence providers' utility. To optimize profit and social
  welfare, APs and regulators need to design appropriate pricing strategies and
  regulatory policies that take the effects of network congestion into
  consideration. In this paper, we model two-sided networks under which users'
  traffic demands are influenced by exogenous pricing and endogenous congestion
  parameters and derive the system congestion under an equilibrium. We
  characterize the structures and sensitivities of profit- and welfare-optimal
  two-sided pricing schemes and reveal that 1) the elasticity of system
  throughput plays a crucial role in determining the structures of optimal
  pricing, 2) the changes of optimal pricing under varying AP's capacity and
  users' congestion sensitivity are largely driven by the type of data traffic,
  e.g., text or video, and 3) APs and regulators will be incentivized to shift
  from one-sided to two-sided pricing when APs' capacities and user demand for
  video traffic grow. Our results can help APs design optimal two-sided pricing
  and guide regulators to legislate desirable policies.

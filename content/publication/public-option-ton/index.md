abstract: "Network neutrality and the role of regulation on the Internet have
  been heavily debated in recent times. Among the various definitions of network
  neutrality, we focus on the one that prohibits paid prioritization of content.
  We develop a model of the Internet ecosystem in terms of three primary
  players: consumers, ISPs, and content providers. We analyze this issue from
  the point of view of the consumer and target the desired system state that
  maximizes consumer utility. By analyzing various structures of an ISP market,
  we obtain different conclusions on the desirability of regulation. We also
  introduce the notion of a Public Option ISP, an ISP that carries traffic in a
  network-neutral manner. We find: in a monopolistic scenario, network-neutral
  regulations might benefit consumers, however the introduction of a Public
  Option ISP is even better as it aligns the interests of the monopolistic ISP
  with the consumer utility; and in an oligopolistic scenario, the presence of a
  Public Option ISP is again preferable to network-neutral regulations, although
  the presence of competing nonneutral ISPs provides the most desirable
  situation for the consumers."

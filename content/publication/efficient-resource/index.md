abstract: Through virtualization technologies, modern enterprises can build
  private clouds to support the daily operations of their subsidiaries and
  consolidate resources from them. In making these resource allocation and
  consolidation decisions, they want to maximize the achieved utilities and
  minimize the incurred costs by their subsidiaries, respectively. However,
  these subsidiaries very often operate autonomously and have private
  information about job characteristics and energy costs. Due to this
  information asymmetry, they might be motivated to behave in their own best
  interests rather than that of the enterprise. To solve these principal-agent
  problems, we design a tunable auction under which subsidiaries submit bids and
  resources are allocated in proportion to their bids. We show that the induced
  competition game obtains a unique Nash equilibrium, under which hidden
  characteristics of subsidiaries can be revealed. By using variational
  inequality techniques, we derive the dynamics of the Nash equilibrium as a
  function of the auction parameters. We design a feedback control mechanism to
  dynamically adjust the tunable auction parameters based on observable
  information such as the bids and the resulting allocations. We prove that our
  adaptive auction converges to the optimal Nash equilibrium under which the
  aggregate utility of an enterprise is maximized.

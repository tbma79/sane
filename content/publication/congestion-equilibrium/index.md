abstract: In this paper, we develop the notion of congestion equilibrium in
  large scale networks, with the specific goal of understanding the modern
  multiparty Internet ecosystem comprising of content providers, ISPs and users.
  We show that the concept of "congestion-taking" is analogous to the concept of
  "price-taking" in classical market economics. With a wide variety of
  congestion metrics and under very mild assumptions on the congestion dynamics,
  we characterize various properties of congestion equilibria and develop
  algorithms to compute them for large scale networks. Our work provides a new
  way to model and analyze modern large scale network-economic systems that have
  a complex interaction of engineering and economics.

abstract: With the rise of video streaming and cloud services, the Internet has
  evolved into a content-centric service platform. Due to the best-effort
  service model of the Internet, the quality of service (QoS) of Internet
  services however cannot be guaranteed. Furthermore, characterizing QoS is
  challenging since it depends on the autonomous business decisions such as
  capacity planning, routing strategies and peering agreements of network
  providers. To quantify the QoS for Internet-based services, we regard the
  Internet infrastructure as a transport system for data packets and study the
  Internet ecosystem and the economics of transport services collectively
  provided by the autonomous network providers. In contrast to the traditional
  transport economics that studies the movement of people and goods over space
  and time, our focus in the Internet transport economics is the movement of
  streams of data packets that create information services. In particular, we
  model the supply of network capacities and demands of throughput driven by
  network protocols and establish a macroscopic network equilibrium under which
  both the end-to-end delays and drop rates of Internet routes can be derived.
  We show that this equilibrium solution always exists and its uniqueness can be
  guaranteed under various realistic scenarios. We analyze the impacts of user
  demands and resource capacities on the network equilibrium and provide
  implications of Netflix-Comcast type of peering on the QoS of users. We
  demonstrate that our framework can be used as a building block to understand
  the routing strategies under a Wardrop equilibrium and to enable further
  studies such as Internet peering and in-network caching.

abstract: "The net neutrality debate has been centered on the question: should
  Internet service providers (ISPs) be allowed to differentiate services for
  Internet content traffic? The concern is that the differentiation imposed by
  selfish ISPs might discriminate content providers (CPs) and harm social
  welfare. Although market competition among ISPs would alleviate the problem
  and moderate the necessity for net neutrality regulations, the problem remains
  in monopolistic access markets. We focus on such a market and study paid
  prioritization where CPs voluntarily pay for prioritizing their traffic under
  shared capacity. We study an ISP's pricing strategy, CPs' choices of priority,
  and the resulting system equilibrium, based on which we derive the utility of
  the ISP and CPs as well as social welfare. This paper shows that: 1) an ISP's
  optimal pricing leads to an efficient differentiation among CPs, such that
  social welfare is close to its maximum; 2) although ISPs might inhibit
  capacity deployment in the short run, price regulation could solve this issue;
  and 3) under medium system scale and capacity cost, ISPs would have strong
  incentives to expand capacity under paid prioritization. From a welfare
  perspective, our results suggest that paid prioritization could be superior to
  the imposition of net neutrality regulations."

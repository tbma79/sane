abstract: Within the current Internet, autonomous ISPs implement bilateral
  agreements, with each ISP establishing agreements that suit its own local
  objective to maximize its profit. Peering agreements based on local views and
  bilateral settlements, while expedient, encourage selfish routing strategies
  and discriminatory interconnections. From a more global perspective, such
  settlements reduce aggregate profits, limit the stability of routes, and
  discourage potentially useful peering/connectivity arrangements, thereby
  unnecessarily balkanizing the Internet. We show that if the distribution of
  profits is enforced at a global level, then there exist profit-sharing
  mechanisms derived from the coalition games concept of Shapley value and its
  extensions that will encourage these selfish ISPs who seek to maximize their
  own profits to converge to a Nash equilibrium. We show that these
  profit-sharing schemes exhibit several fairness properties that support the
  argument that this distribution of profits is desirable. In addition, at the
  Nash equilibrium point, the routing and connecting/peering strategies maximize
  aggregate network profits and encourage ISP connectivity so as to limit
  balkanization.

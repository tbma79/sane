abstract: "Internet services are traditionally priced at flat rates; however,
  many Internet service providers (ISPs) have recently shifted toward two-part
  tariffs where a data cap is imposed to restrain data demand from heavy users.
  Although the two-part tariff could generally increase the revenue for ISPs and
  has been supported by the U.S. FCC, the role of data cap and its optimal
  pricing structures are not well understood. In this paper, we study the impact
  of data cap on the optimal two-part pricing schemes for congestion-prone
  service markets. We model users' demand and preferences over pricing and
  congestion alternatives and derive the market share and congestion of service
  providers under a market equilibrium. Based on the equilibrium model, we
  characterize the two-part structures of the revenue- and welfare-optimal
  pricing schemes. Our results reveal that: 1) the data cap provides a mechanism
  for ISPs to make a transition from the flat-rate to pay-as-you-go type of
  schemes; 2) both of the revenue and welfare objectives will drive ISP's
  pricing toward more usage-based schemes with diminishing data caps; and 3) the
  welfare-optimal tariff comprises lower fees than the revenue-optimal
  counterpart, suggesting that regulators might want to promote usage-based
  pricing but regulate the lump-sum and per-unit fees."

abstract: "Unlike telephone operators, which pay termination fees to reach the
  users of another network, Internet content providers (CPs) do not pay the
  Internet service providers (ISPs) of users they reach. While the consequent
  cross subsidization to CPs has nurtured content innovations at the edge of the
  Internet, it reduces the investment incentives for the access ISPs to expand
  capacity. As potential charges for terminating CPs' traffic are criticized
  under the net neutrality debate, we propose to allow CPs to voluntarily
  subsidize the usage-based fees induced by their content traffic for end-users.
  We model the regulated subsidization competition among the CPs under a neutral
  network and show how deregulation of subsidization could increase an access
  ISP's utilization and revenue, strengthening its investment incentives. Our
  results suggest that subsidization competition will increase the
  competitiveness and welfare of the Internet content market. However,
  regulators might need to: 1) regulate access prices if the access ISP market
  is not competitive enough; and 2) regulate subsidies if network is highly
  congested. We envision that subsidization competition could become a viable
  net-neutral model for the future Internet."
